2. Environmental Variables layers collection and processing

a. Environamental variables collection

Worldclim  https://worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html  (there are version 2.1 and 1.4), Climate, Current, Past (lgm, lig, mh), Future (2050, 2070)
Soilgrid   https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/latest/data_aggregated/; https://soilgrids.org/, Soil, Current
EarthEnv   https://www.earthenv.org/topography, topography, Current
##Climond    https://www.climond.org/, climate, Current and Future (Optional)
##Chelsa     https://chelsa-climate.org/, Current and Future (Optional)

b. Processing

(1) tif files download

(2) projection (arcmap)

(3) add Meter unit and projection Mercator (arcmap)

(4) Intersect (arcmap)

(5) Mask (arcmap)

(6) convert tif to asc files (arcmap)

(7) current dataset with both tif and asc, tif for flexsdm and value check, asc for maxent

(8) future and past dataset will have both future or past climate variables and current soil and topography variables

(9) Makesure that names of different periods dataset have same names of factors for maxent analysis
